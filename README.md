# Sudoku - Team of 5 

**Guide**
##
At the beginning of the game, you will be prompted to choose a level of difficulty. The level 
that you choose will determine how many blank spaces are in the puzzle. If you select easy, 
there will be 26 blanks in the puzzle and 55 answers. For medium, there will be 36 blanks and 
45 answers. For hard, there will be 46 blanks and 35 answers.

The original board will print in gray so that you know what numbers are correct. Numbers 
that you input will be printed in red. 

The computer will prompt you to select what a grid space you would like to fill in. You must enter a
coordinate in the form of LetterNumber, for example (a5, f7, e9, etc.). Each letter a through i stands
for a row and each number stands for a column, these letters and numbers will be printed on the 
outside of the board.

Now that youâ€™ve entered a coordinate, it will prompt you to enter what number you want in that 
specific cell. If that row and column is part of the orignally printed board, anything printed in grey,
it will tell you that that cell cannot be changed. 

Every time you enter a number into a cell, a new puzzle board will be printed. This allows you to see what you have inputted.

**Rules**
##
Depending on which level you choose, there will be a certain amount of numbers filled 
into the puzzle board. The remaining blank spaces are where you should fill in your 
answers to the solution.
The main rule of Sudoku is to fill in the Sudoku puzzle so that each and every row, column, 
and region contains the numbers one through nine only once.
For more specific rules, read below.

Rows:
There are 9 rows in a traditional Sudoku puzzle. Every row must contain the numbers 1 
through 9. No number should be in the same row more than once. In other words, no two 
rows should be identical.

Columns:
There are 9 columns in a traditional Sudoku puzzle. Like the Sudoku rule for rows, every 
column must also contain the numbers 1 through 9. Again, no number should be in the same column 
more than once. Each column should be unique.

Regions:
A region is a 3x3 box. There are 9 regions in a traditional Sudoku puzzle.
Like the Sudoku rules for rows and columns, every region must also contain the numbers 1 through 
9. There should not be any duplicate numbers in any region. No two regions will be the same.
